## Hello there ...
I'm Till, a recent M.Sc. Informatics: Game Engineering graduate. Currently pursuing a career in the IT industry.
I have experience in Godot Engine, Server Administration and Game Design.

* üìù Master of To-Do lists
* üá∫üá≥ Language learning enthusiast

### üíª Programming/markup languages

My strongest programming language is C++, with some training in C.
I did some light scripting with Python and Shell Script during software practicals.
As a working student I programmed a small software module in R for the CoopGame R package.
I have used Java on and off since high school but only if I needed to, e.g. software practicals.
Usually my presentations and documents are done with LaTeX.

### üõ†Ô∏è Tools and software
I am daily driving Manjaro Linux as my distro and have set up servers with ArchLinux during software practicals.
During a software practical I set up a working replicated instance of MariaDB on two VMs and can write SQL.
Since 2018 I am developing a game side project with Godot Engine, so I have experience with it; I dabbled a bit in Unreal Engine during practicals.
Git is primarily used for version controlling my projects.
During the years I have also collected experience on working with Microsoft Visual Studio.
I know my way around the basics of Blender modelling, rigging, exporting.
